## How to deploy on your web server

Instructions to install this WebApp on a shared web hosting service or a dedicated server under Linux.

### Dedicated Server or Virtual Private Server

This part is for administrators who have full access to their own server.  
If it's your case, connect to your server with SSH then...

- Move the Current Directory to your web root and clone the project:

```
cd /var/www
git clone https://github.com/wuwanahq/wuwana2.git
```

- Modify the configuration's file for the database connection in `Models/WebApp/Config.php` and add your changes in Git:

```
cd /var/www/wuwana2
nano Models/WebApp/Config.php
git update-index --skip-worktree Models/WebApp/Config.php
```

- If you don't want to use `.htaccess` files you have to copy the parameters in your server configuration in order to use permalinks.

Your website is now ready!  
Later, if you want to update the WebApp, just run `git pull` in the project directory.

### PHP shared web hosting

This part is for webmasters who just have a website hosting service.  
If it's your case, check if your hosting solution is compatible with PHP 5.6+ and able to rewrite URL (Apache mod_rewrite, FallbackResource directive or Nginx "try_files" directive).  
Then...

- Clone the project on your computer: `git clone https://github.com/wuwanahq/wuwana2.git`
- Modify the configuration's file to add your database connection parameters in `Models/WebApp/Config.php`
- In the Command Prompt type `git update-index --skip-worktree Models/WebApp/Config.php`
- Copy all project's files at the root of your web hosting service with a FTP client.

Your website is ready, you can now go to the homepage!

Later, if you want to update the WebApp, just run `git pull` on your computer in the project directory then re-upload all files in your web hosting with FTP.
